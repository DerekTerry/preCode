comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation is 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase (i.e mitotic DNA replication for mitotic S-phase). To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

comment: Note that this term represents a location, not a function; the activity possessed by this complex is mentioned in the definition for the purpose of describing and distinguishing the complex. The function of this complex is represented by the molecular function term 'histone acetyltransferase activity ; GO:0004402'.
